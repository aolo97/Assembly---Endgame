Assembly: Endgame

**Assembly: Endgame** is a fun word guessing game where you must guess the correct word within 8 attempts to save the programming world from the dangers of Assembly! Each time you guess a letter, you reveal part of the word or lose one attempt. The game ends when you've either guessed the word or run out of attempts.
